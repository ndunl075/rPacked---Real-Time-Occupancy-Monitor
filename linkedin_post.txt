🚀 Excited to share rPacked - my latest full-stack project that solves a real problem for Ohio State students!

As a Buckeye, I've always wanted to check how busy the RPAC gym is before heading over. So I built a real-time capacity tracker that automatically scrapes and displays live occupancy data across all 15+ locations.

✨ **What it does:**
• Automatically scrapes RPAC capacity data every 15 minutes via GitHub Actions
• Real-time updates using Firebase Firestore listeners
• Beautiful, mobile-responsive dashboard with Ohio State branding
• Shows open/closed status, available spots, and visual progress bars
• Live "last scraped" timestamp that updates automatically

🔧 **Technical Stack:**
**Backend & Automation:**
• Python with Selenium for dynamic web scraping
• BeautifulSoup4 for HTML parsing
• Firebase Admin SDK for secure database writes
• GitHub Actions for automated CI/CD (runs every 15 minutes)

**Frontend:**
• Vanilla JavaScript with ES6+ modules
• Custom CSS (zero framework dependencies)
• Firebase JS SDK for real-time data synchronization
• Smooth animations and transitions

**Infrastructure:**
• Firebase Firestore for real-time NoSQL database
• Firebase Hosting for static site deployment
• GitHub Actions for serverless automation

🎯 **Key Learnings:**
• Web scraping dynamic, JavaScript-rendered content with Selenium
• Real-time database synchronization with Firebase listeners
• Serverless automation and CI/CD pipelines
• Building production-ready full-stack applications
• Error handling and robust logging for automated systems

This project demonstrates full-stack development skills, automation expertise, and problem-solving - turning a daily frustration into a useful tool for the OSU community!
